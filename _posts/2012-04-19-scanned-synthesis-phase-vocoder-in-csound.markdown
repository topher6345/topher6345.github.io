Here's a more transparent example of what the audio effect does to an audio sample.

[]()[]()

Lets start with a short bar of one of my favorite composers, Maurice Ravel.

This is a short clip, the first few bars of 
String quartet in F (1903) Mvmt. II - Assez vif - Tres rythme performed by the Alan Berg Quartet.

A nice sample to demonstrate how it is being stretched and compressed. We can hear a directional melody, a driving rythmn and familiar timbres.

Here's how it sounds once it's put through Scan4LivePVOC.

smeared and time-altered, like we can't remember which part you heard and which part you're about to hear.

And another example:
