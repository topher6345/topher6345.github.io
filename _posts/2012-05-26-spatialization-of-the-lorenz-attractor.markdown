Put on your headphones to experience binaural spatialization of the lorenz attractor, using a drum loop as the sound source.

This 3D graph shows us how a particle travels in the Lorenz system.

The Lorenz Attractor is a mathematical equation discovered by 
[Edward Lorenz, pioneer of Chaos Theory.](http://physicstoday.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_61/iss_9/81_1.shtml?bypassSSO=1)

I used Csound and the opcode 
[lorenz written by Hans Mikelson to do the processing.](http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/lorenz.html)

The loop was made by BT for the OLPC sample
